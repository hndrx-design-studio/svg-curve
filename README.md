# svg-curve
A symmetrical quadratic Bezier curve SVG, peaking at the center to form a smooth arc. Ideal for UI dividers or decorative elements.

This SVG graphic features a symmetrical quadratic Bezier curve, creating a smooth and elegant arc that is convex in shape. The curve is defined by a path that starts and ends at the baseline of the SVG's viewBox, with a single control point that pulls the path upward to form a gentle peak at the center.
